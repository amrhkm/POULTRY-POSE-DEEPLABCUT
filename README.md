#Problem Statement
Recently, poultry disease outbreaks have occurred frequently, harming the poultry industry. Currently, the conventional method for monitoring poultry disease is mainly by manually observing poultry posture, feathers, cockscombs, feces, and sounds. However, the problem with manual observation is that large-scale production requires many people to perform regular inspections. It is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, making it harder to detect sick poultry early. Hence, human surveillance has ceased to be a viable solution in livestock farming. Instead, precision Livestock Farming (PLF) has been used to solve these challenges by using efficient automated systems while at the same time maintaining animal welfare. 

#Proposed Solution
With the advancement of artificial intelligence and specifically in the branch of the deep convolutional network, this research proposed an automated system that could
detect the poultryâ€™s body keypoints using a deep convolutional network. Obtaining the body keypoints of poultry is a crucial step in developing an automated system that
could detect the poultry's mobility or posture. However, this research is focusing on posture estimation rather than mobility due to the type of data that could be gathered.

Below is the list of objectives for this research.
- To produce a poultry dataset that is annotated with the body keypoints.
- To propose a deep learning model that can detect the keypoints of a poultry
on a video.
- To compare the accuracy of the proposed models to other models with
different hyperparameters and backbones.

# POULTRY-POSE-DEEPLABCUTV2.

Below is the list of objectives for this paper.
- To produce a poultry dataset that is annotated with the body keypoints.
- To propose a deep learning model that can detect the keypoints of a poultry
on a video.
- To compare the accuracy of the proposed models to other models with
different hyperparameters and backbones.


This repo is for my Project 2 thesis results.
The notebook named "startingwith_DeepLabCut" is presenting the necessary codes to run deeplabcut (particularly the library installed and the folder path).


All the codes used here is the common DeepLabCut command, to understand the parameters of each commands visit dlc docstrings: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/wiki/DOCSTRINGS#


A poultry dataset to train a DNN that can detect keypoints on poultry with deeplabcut v2.
